## Section 1:
You can start this section following *session 1*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Load the farmersmarket.db and browse its content
- Create a logical data model

<br>
If this is your first time in DB Browser for SQLite, the following instructions may help:

#### 1) Load Database
- Open DB Browser for SQLite
- Go to File > Open Database
- Navigate to your farmersmarket.db 
	- This will be wherever you cloned the GH Repo (within the **05_src/sql** folder)
	- ![db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite_choose_db.png)

#### 2) Configure your windows
By default, DB Browser for SQLite has three windows, with four tabs in the main window and three tabs in the bottom right window
- Window 1: Main Window (Centre)
	- Stay in the Database Structure tab for now
- Window 2: Edit Database Cell (Top Right)
- Window 3: Remote (Bottom Right)
	- Switch this to DB Schema tab (very bottom)

Your screen should look like this (or very similar)
![db_browser_for_sqlite.png](./images/01_db_browser_for_sqlite.png)

#### 3) The farmersmarket.db
There are 10 tables in the Main Window:
1) booth
2) customer
3) customer_purchases
4) market_date_info
5) product
6) product_category
7) vendor
8) vendor_booth_assignments
9) vendor_inventory
10) postal_data

Switch to the Browse Data tab, booth is selected by default

Using the table drop down at the top left, explore some of the contents of the database

<img src="./images/01_the_table_drop_down_at_the_top_left.png" width="200">

Move on to the Logical Data Model task when you have looked through the tables


### Build Logical Data Model

Recall during session 1:

I diagramed the following four tables:
- product
- product_category
- vendor
- vendor_inventory

 <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_logical_model_partial.png" width="500">


#### Prompt 1:
Choose two tables and create a logical data model. There are lots of tools you can do this (including drawing this by hand), but I'd recommend [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) or [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/). 

A logical data model must contain:
- table name
- column names
- relationship type

Please do not pick the exact same tables that I have already diagrammed. For example, you shouldn't diagram the relationship between `product` and `product_category`, but you could diagram `product` and `customer_purchases`.

**HINTS**:
- You will need to use the Browse Data tab in the main window to figure out the relationship types.
- You can't diagram tables that don't share a common column
	- These are the tables that are connected
	- <img src="./images/01_farmers_market_conceptual_model.png" width="600">
- The column names can be found in a few spots (DB Schema window in the bottom right, the Database Structure tab in the main window by expanding each table entry, at the top of the Browse Data tab in the main window)

## Section 2:
You can start this section following *session 2*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### SELECT
1. Write a query that returns everything in the customer table.
2. Write a query that displays all of the columns and 10 rows from the customer table, sorted by customer_last_name, then customer_first_ name.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### WHERE
1. Write a query that returns all customer purchases of product IDs 4 and 9.
2. Write a query that returns all customer purchases and a new calculated column 'price' (quantity * cost_to_customer_per_qty), filtered by customer IDs between 8 and 10 (inclusive) using either:
	1.  two conditions using AND
	2.  one condition using BETWEEN

<div align="center">-</div>

#### CASE
1. Products can be sold by the individual unit or by bulk measures like lbs. or oz. Using the product table, write a query that outputs the `product_id` and `product_name` columns and add a column called `prod_qty_type_condensed` that displays the word “unit” if the `product_qty_type` is “unit,” and otherwise displays the word “bulk.”

2. We want to flag all of the different types of pepper products that are sold at the market. Add a column to the previous query called `pepper_flag` that outputs a 1 if the product_name contains the word “pepper” (regardless of capitalization), and otherwise outputs 0.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### JOIN
1. Write a query that `INNER JOIN`s the `vendor` table to the `vendor_booth_assignments` table on the `vendor_id` field they both have in common, and sorts the result by `vendor_name`, then `market_date`.

***

## Section 3:
You can start this section following *session 3*.

Steps to complete this part of the assignment:
- Open the assignment1.sql file in DB Browser for SQLite:
	- from [Github](./02_activities/assignments/assignment1.sql)
	- or, from your local forked repository  
- Complete each question

### Write SQL

#### AGGREGATE
1. Write a query that determines how many times each vendor has rented a booth at the farmer’s market by counting the vendor booth assignments per `vendor_id`.
2. The Farmer’s Market Customer Appreciation Committee wants to give a bumper sticker to everyone who has ever spent more than $2000 at the market. Write a query that generates a list of customers for them to give stickers to, sorted by last name, then first name.
   
**HINT**: This query requires you to join two tables, use an aggregate function, and use the HAVING keyword.

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Temp Table
1. Insert the original vendor table into a temp.new_vendor and then add a 10th vendor: Thomass Superfood Store, a Fresh Focused store, owned by Thomas Rosenthal
   
**HINT**: This is two total queries -- first create the table from the original, then insert the new 10th vendor. When inserting the new vendor, you need to appropriately align the columns to be inserted (there are five columns to be inserted, I've given you the details, but not the syntax)

To insert the new row use VALUES, specifying the value you want for each column:  
`VALUES(col1,col2,col3,col4,col5)`

<div align="center">-</div>

#### Date
1. Get the customer_id, month, and year (in separate columns) of every purchase in the customer_purchases table.
   
**HINT**: you might need to search for strfrtime modifers sqlite on the web to know what the modifers for month and year are!

2. Using the previous query as a base, determine how much money each customer spent in April 2022. Remember that money spent is `quantity*cost_to_customer_per_qty`.
   
**HINTS**: you will need to AGGREGATE, GROUP BY, and filter...but remember, STRFTIME returns a STRING for your WHERE statement!!

**What values systems are embedded in databases and data systems you encounter in your day-to-day life?**

Consider, for example, concepts of fariness, inequality, social structures, marginalization, intersection of technology and society, etc.

Delphine Ji
The story of Pakistan’s National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) shows that data systems are never neutral. When an “Error: Unmarried Mother” message can block a citizen from renewing an ID, we see how software silently enforces a social worldview. Database design decisions—about which fields are mandatory, what relationships can exist, and what counts as “valid” input—end up encoding political and cultural values as technical rules.

At its core, NADRA’s relational schema ties every record to a predefined family tree: two married parents, their biological children, and male household heads. What appears to be a logical data model—entities, keys, and relationships—is in fact a digital expression of patriarchy and heteronormativity. A schema meant to ensure accuracy and efficiency becomes a mechanism of exclusion. If someone’s life does not match the database’s assumptions—an orphan, a single parent, a queer couple, a refugee—the system literally cannot represent them. They cease to exist in the digital nation.

Riz’s experience renewing his ID shows how a technical schema can hard-code social expectations. His mother’s decision decades earlier not to change her surname became a “data error.” In an analog bureaucracy, human clerks could overlook such inconsistencies; in a digitized one, the logic of the database overrides human judgment. The design choice to make “married = TRUE” a required condition embedded a moral stance: legitimacy flows through formal marriage.

The NADRA database inherits older colonial and post-partition record-keeping practices that equated identity with lineage. Because citizenship itself is verified through ancestry, family structures became the logical backbone of the system. This legacy reveals how technology evolves within historical and political contexts. Databases reflect the priorities of those in power—here, the state’s need to define who counts as a “real” citizen and who does not.

We encounter similar value systems in databases we use daily, though often in subtler ways. University registration forms that allow only “male” or “female” replicate binary gender assumptions. Banking systems that require a “legal surname” privilege certain naming conventions and erase Indigenous or hyphenated names. Social-media algorithms amplify popular or normative content, rewarding conformity and marginalizing minority voices. Even health apps often presume one biological baseline, making them less accurate for people outside that data norm.

In each case, the schema—the list of allowable fields and relationships—decides which identities can exist in the system and which must be approximated, hidden, or falsified. The technical phrase “data validation” carries moral weight: whose lives are validated, and whose are rejected as “invalid entry.”

Designers often describe relational databases as objective because their logic is mathematical. But fairness cannot be achieved through computation alone. For example, NADRA added more gender options after a court order, yet the fix did not solve deeper issues around family linkage. Because every record still requires two parents, khawaja sira citizens and orphans remain trapped in bureaucratic limbo. This demonstrates that bias is not always a matter of malicious code—it lives in the structural rules that define relationships. Once those relationships are baked into millions of records, changing them becomes technically and politically costly.

Engineers must recognize that social categories change faster than code. Instead of assuming stability, systems should anticipate diversity and future revision. Simple design choices—such as allowing null values for parent fields, or using flexible ENUM data types for gender—can make databases more inclusive and easier to adapt. Beyond the schema, institutions should create governance processes where sociologists, legal scholars, and affected communities help define data standards. Identity is not merely a technical variable; it is lived reality.

For me, the key lesson from this article is that every dataset embodies a worldview. When we normalize those embedded assumptions, we risk reproducing inequality at scale. Just as NADRA’s schema enforces a particular vision of family, our own data systems—student records, employment portals, medical databases—carry implicit judgments about what a “normal” life looks like. If designers do not question those defaults, technology will continue to discipline people into categories rather than reflect their complexity.

Databases are social artifacts disguised as technical tools. The NADRA case reminds us that fairness, inclusion, and justice must be engineered intentionally. The goal is not simply to collect accurate data but to design infrastructures that recognize human variety. Good design, as software engineer Jehangir Amjad notes, accepts change as inevitable. A truly ethical database would treat flexibility not as a bug but as a feature—allowing our digital systems to evolve alongside the societies they claim to represent.
